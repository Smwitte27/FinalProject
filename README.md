# FinalProject
Final project for APCS

This project is a cardgame called "George" that some people in my family made up awhile ago and have played it almost everytime we get together. This game shares some similarities with a plethera of different card games.
### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

The toughest part of this project was getting all of the processes to actually output something and linking them all together to create an interactive game vs just the processes that happen to make it work.

### Most interesting piece of your code and explanation for what it does.
